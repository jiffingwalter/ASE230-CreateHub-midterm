LOGIC ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
users:
- need to add to signup & admin user manager
- give user option to edit their own info and delete their account, as well as their posts and portfolios
- need to experiment to make sure user cant cheat system and view/make posts by other users. maybe make sure post belongs to the userID on page load?

posts:
- add logic to delete and edit portfolios
- modify database population file to have incremential ids for tags, portfolios, and attachments (to avoid issues when attachments are deleted)

other:
- update attachment functions to rename attachments when uploading them to server (prof said this was good practice)
- convert users and posts to object-oriented style? (saving this for very last if we have time and wanna extra points since its not required. would be good practice tho)
- go through and remove code thats not used anymore (pre db stuff?)

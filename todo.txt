ADMIN post pages:
- refactor admin post handling to support the multi-file format in each user folder
- make the "author" section of create/edit posts be a dropdown of existing users instead of typing it in

general:
- move post.php and users.php functions into main file that can be shared between admin section and normal section, chain the shared files back to admin pages
- and much more!

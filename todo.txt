LOGIC ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
users:
- update user handling functions to pull from database instead of csv
- add option for user's name?
- give user option to edit their own info and delete their account, as well as their posts and portfolios
- need to experiment to make sure user cant cheat system and view/make posts by other users. maybe make sure post belongs to the userID?

posts:
- update post handling functions to pull from database instead of json files (this one will suck!)
- add logic to delete and edit portfolios

other:
- make sure session calls are all before any html (think this is done after but may need to check again)
----^ session_start() is now called in /lib/global.php, requiring this file first on all user pages should solve this issue
- look into session_destroy warning on logout, possibly related to above?
- convert users and posts to object-oriented style? (saving this for very last if we have time and wanna extra points since its not required. would be good practice tho)
